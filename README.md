# Portafolio

![Alt text](img/lion2.jpg)

This project is to make my first portafolio as a developer. This is a page to continue working with and developing in the future. 

## Description

This is my portafolio as front-end developer. Here I present my projects from the first year of study in Noroff.  

In this portafolio, you will see my three bigest projects done this year:
•	Your cross-course project

You will be creating a README.md file at the root of each of these projects and then documenting the submissions following a given format.

## Acknowledgments

I am grateful for the help given from the teachers in Noroff to get to understand and progress on my studies and getting the tools to be able to make this project. Also to the fellow students, for the chats and encouraging words, those are precious in times of stress and frustration. Also, to my family that has shown me patients in my journey to get another career, giving me the space needed to study and work.
